# AliceBot

IRC chatbot that uses an AI API to generate messages

# IRC/Discord commands and usage

- `!forget` will make the bot forget the current conversation, only keeping her presentation and memories acquired
  through `!remember`
- `!remember Your text` will insert a message from you in the bot's memory formatted like `yourNick: Your text` (only
  one `!remember` per user)
- `!remember` will delete your remembered message
- `!Blah blah blah` will send the message without any memory besides the `noContextSentence` included in personality
  translation file
  - You can use the `!` prefix to ask questions without using the context (it gives the **best** results)
- `?Blah blah blah` will simply trigger the bot to talk after your message
- `?` will simply trigger the bot to talk
- `,` is a special command **only to be used when the bot sends an incomplete message**
- `Â²` will make Alice rewrite entirely her last message
- `!mute` Prevents the bot from receiving and sending messages (PMs still work)
- `!unmute`
- `!lang <language>` will load the `translations/aiPersonality/${process.env.BOTNAME}/<language>.json`
  file, useful to change the bot personality
  - Available personalities for Alice: `en-EN`, `en-NSFW`, `en-GURO` and `fr-FR`
- [NSFW] `!r34` will send a link to a random picture from rule34.xxx
- [NSFW] `!r34 alice_in_wonderland` is the default, but you can also search multiple tags separated by a space
- `!prompt <number of tokens to generate>\n<your prompt>` will execute your prompt and return X tokens depending on your argument
  - This command can be used freely without the bot remembering either the command nor the output
  - It can be used as a tool to test evalbots, or just to use the AI model with your own prompt

# Prerequisites for 6B parameters AI model

Then paste the generated API URL to the `conf.json` file `apiUrl` property

# Prerequisites for 2.7B parameters AI model
